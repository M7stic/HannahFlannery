# **The Reality Check: Insights from Melbourne Devs**

## What 8 Victorian Developers Actually Told Me

Over the past eight weeks, I reached out to over 70 game studios in Melbourne and asked about their experiences with funding, and honestly? The results are kind of wild. Here's what I learned from the eight deveolpers who responded to my survey.

### Who I Spoke With

The group was a real mix, we had solo deveopers, small teams of 2-5 people (that was 75%), and a couple of slightly bigger studioes with 6-10 people. Roles were spread across programming, art, design, adn studio leadership. Basically, I got persepctives from pretty much every angle of game development.

### How People Are Actually Funding Their Games

This one suprised me. The most common funding across sources were:

- **Publisher Advances** (4 deve)
- **Government Grants** like the VPF (4 devs)
- **Revenue from previously released games** (3 devs)
- **Day jobs or freelance work outside games** (2 devs)

  What's interesting is that most developers are juggling multiple funding across sources at once. Nobody's relying on just one thing. As one developer put it, "Game development requires resilience and persistence."

  ### The Money Problems Are Real

  When I asked about the single bigest financial challege, half of the developers said it was **"funding development long enugh to finish the game."**

  Only one person said they had no financial problems because their project was fully funded. Two developers specifically mentioned strugglign to pay themselves a sustainable wage.

  This really drives home the **"funding cliff"** problem,; even when you get some money, it's often not enough to actualy see a project through to completion.

  ### VPF Experiences: The Good, The Bad, The Honest

  Six of the eight developers had actually applied for the VPF, and their experiences were... mixed.

  **The Positive Stuff:**
  - "It was a great experuence and the people were opn to calls/discussions"
  - "VicScreen are very kind and supportive"
  - "The process is very structured and the criteria for assessment is clearly articulated"
  - "The process is very structured and the cri"
