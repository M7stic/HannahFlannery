# **The Reality Check: Insights from Melbourne Devs**

## What 8 Victorian Developers Actually Told Me

Over the past eight weeks, I reached out to over 70 game studios in Melbourne and asked about their experiences with funding, and honestly? The results are kind of wild. Here's what I learned from the eight deveolpers who responded to my survey.

### Who I Spoke With

The group was a real mix, we had solo deveopers, small teams of 2-5 people (that was 75%), and a couple of slightly bigger studioes with 6-10 people. Roles were spread across programming, art, design, adn studio leadership. Basically, I got persepctives from pretty much every angle of game development.

### How People Are Actually Funding Their Games

This one suprised me. The most common funding across sources were:

- **Publisher Advances** (4 deve)
- **Government Grants** like the VPF (4 devs)
- **Revenue from previously released games** (3 devs)
- **Day jobs or freelance work outside games** (2 devs)

  What's interesting is that most developers are juggling multiple funding across sources at once. Nobody's relying on just one thing. As one developer put it, "Game development requires resilience and persistence."

  ### The Money Problems Are Real

  When I asked about the single bigest financial challege, half of the developers said it was **"funding development long enugh to finish the game."**

  Only one person said they had no financial problems because their project was fully funded. Two developers specifically mentioned strugglign to pay themselves a sustainable wage.

  This really drives home the **"funding cliff"** problem,; even when you get some money, it's often not enough to actualy see a project through to completion.

  ### VPF Experiences: The Good, The Bad, The Honest

  Six of the eight developers had actually applied for the VPF, and their experiences were... mixed.

  **The Positive Stuff:**
  - "It was a great experuence and the people were opn to calls/discussions"
  - "VicScreen are very kind and supportive"
  - "The process is very structured and the criteria for assessment is clearly articulated"
  - "The documents they ask you to produce are beneficial to other aspects of development"
 
  - **The Challenges:**
  - "Very competitive, a lot of time and work must be spent on application materials"
  - "Time consuming, difficult filling out all the documents"
  - "It can be difficult to anticipate what the hierarchy is in terms of how the documentation is assessed"
 
    One developer made a really goodpoint about budgets: "It's important to keep in mind that a budget is a hypothesis. You can't anticipate all costs because tings change in production"

    ### Budget Confidence is All Over the Place

    This was probably the most suprising finding. When I asked developers to rate their confidence in creating realistic grant budgets on a scale of 1-10, the answers ranged from 2 to 10.

    We had one person at 2/10 confidence, another at 4/10, then a cluster around 6-8/10, and one very confident 10/10. This tells me that budgeting skills are really uneven across the industtry, even experienced game dev's aren't always sure they're doing it right.

    ### What Developers Actually Want

    When I asked "What would the perfect fudning resource be if you could make one up", the answers were really interesting:

    - "Realistic budget exmaples & resources (most creatives have no experience on budgets)"
    - "A template and example"
    - "Automatic budgets for team size and amount."
    - "Feedback - getting someone to look over it before submission"
    - "More transparency around why applications are rejected"
   
    This is exactly why I built the tools on this site. Developers don't need more vague advice, they need concrete, practitcal help with the stuff that's actually hard.

    ## What This All Means

    Reading though these responses, a few things become really clear:

    1. **The VPF application process us a massive time investment** that takes developers away from actual game development
    2. **Budgeting is a major pain point** for a lot of developers, regardless of experience level
    3. **The funding rarely lasts long enough** to actually finish games properly.
    4. **Developers want practical tools, not just advice**, they need templates, examples, and concrete help
   
       As one developer wisely noted:
       "Use something like the VPF application as a mechanism to teach yourself and price things out like accounting, lawyers, insurance ect."

       That's the spririt behind this whole project, turning the painful parts of the application process into learning opportunities that actually make you a better developer.
