# Tales from the Trenches: Raw VPF Stories

## Anonymous. Honest. Real.

These are direct quotes from the 8 Victorian developers who responded to my survey. No editing, no interpretation - just their actual experiences with the VPF application process.

### Story #1: The Supportive But Stressful Experience

*"We have received funding twice and, although the process is time consuming and stressful, VicScreen are very kind and supportive."*

---

### Story #2: The Competitive Reality

*"Very competitive, a lot of time and work must be spent on application materials to stand a chance. The decision in the end doesn't always come down to how good a project is, but more how much budget VicScreen have, what they're looking for, and what type of team you have."*

### Story #3: The Structured But Unpredictable Process

*"Generally we have had a good experience. It's very structured and the criteria for assessment is clearly articulated. It is pretty consistent with other types of funding and the documents they ask you to produce are beneficial to other aspects of development or applying for different funds. It is very time consuming to make sure all of the material speaks to each other. It can be difficult to anticipate what the hierarchy is in terms of how the documentation is assessed, alongside the priorities of the assessors but that is probably the nature of this type of thing."*

### Story #4: The Budget Wisdom

*"To address your below question of budgets, it's important to keep in mind that a budget is a hypothesis. You can't anticipate all costs because things change in production, and there are external economic factors that you have no control over. If this is your first time running a business or a project, use something like the VPF application as a mechanism to teach yourself and price things out like accounting, lawyers, insurance etc."*

### Story #5: The Anonymous Critique

*"Time consuming, judges should be industry professionals picked at random and the company names of applicant and judges should be anonymous. DEI sucks, the product should be the focus."*

---

### Story #6: The Documentation Struggle

*"Difficult filling out all the documents."*

---

### Story #7: The Successful Application

*"It was good, we got funded. I've done many grant applications and think I have a pretty good idea about what kinds of projects they're willing to fund."*

---

### Story #8: The Positive Engagement

*"It was a great experience and the people were open to calls/discussions to greater understand our project needs. My one complaint would be the minimum budget required and what that means in 2025 where budgets overall are shrinking and studios are using more and more AI tools to streamline production."*
