# The VPF Grant: The Real Deal
### Does the grant build a career, or just fund a prototype?

Let's be real. The Victorian Production Fund (VPF) grant looks like a golden ticket. But what happens after the money runs out? Many developers face a "funding cliff" â€“ the grant ends, but the game isn't finished, leaving them in a worse spot than before.

This site is a free, independent toolkit built to help you see the whole picture. I've torn apart the application, crunched the numbers, and spoken to developers to give you a no-BS guide to the VPF.

**Navigate the Grant:**
*   [**The Brutal Budget Calculator**](/calculator/): See how much cash you *really* get after GST and if it's a livable wage.
*   [**The Plain-English Guide**](/guide/): Learn the rules, traps, and how to strengthen your application.
*   [**Share Your Experience**](/survey/): Take my anonymous survey to help other developers.
*   [**Tales from the Trenches**](/tales/): Read anonymous stories from those who've been through it.
