# **The VPF Grant: A Critical Toolkit**

This practice based research project investigates the sustainability of the Victorian Production Fund (VPF) for games. Drawing on cultural policy analysis, industry wage reports, and anonymous survey data from local developers, this site offers a critical and practical deconstruction of the grant application process.

## **Research Question:** 

Can a short term production grant like the VPF foster long-term, sustainable careers for Victorian game developers, or does it prolong a cycle of precarity and a "funding cliff"?

## **Features:**
  
**The Interactive Budget Simulator:** A tool that models the true financial outcome of a VPF grant, factoring in hidden costs and sustainability.

**A Critical Guide to the VPF:** A deconstruction of the guidelines, terms, and the unstated expectations.

**Developer Testimonials:** Anonymous, firsthand accounts of the application experience.

**The Data:**
Summary of findings from our survey of 70+ Melbourne Game Studios.
