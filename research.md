# Research & Article Summaries

This page documents the key sources that shaped my critical analysis of the Victorian Production Fund.

## Critical Review of the Victorian Production Fund Guidelines

**Source:** `Victorian Government. (2023). *Victorian Production Fund guidelines*. VicScreen.`

**My Summary:**
My analysis reveals how the VPF's structural design actively undermines its goal of creating sustainable careers. The staged funding model forces developers into "grant hopping" - constantly reapplying rather than developing games. While Australian indie games typically need 34+ months for completion, VPF funding covers only 12-18 months, creating a dangerous "funding cliff." The guidelines contain contradictory expectations, demanding commercial release strategies while rejecting games deemed "too commercially focused." Most critically, the VPF loads developers with requirements like diversity plans and accessibility features without providing adequate funding or time to implement them properly.

## Analysis of Wu's "When to Join Game Events and Crowdfunding Sites"

**Source:** `Wu, M. (2017). *Case study the indie game industry and help indie developers achieve their success in digital marketing* (Publication No. 10685688) [Master's dissertation, Northeastern University]. ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global.`

**My Summary:**
Wu's research exposes the hidden labor burden that the VPF ignores. Successful indie development requires three layers of unpaid work; community building in early stages, relentless marketing in middle stages, and intensive networking in late stages. Case studies like *Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes* show how crucial early stage collaboration is, while *Exploding Kittens* demonstrates the 24/7 community management needed for crowdfunding success. Yet none of this essential work is fundable through the VPF, which only covers direct production costs.

## Critical Analysis of Port Phillip's Games Action Plan

**Source:** `City of Port Phillip. (2020). *Games Action Plan 2020-2024*. https://www.portphillip.vic.gov.au/`

**My Summary:**
The City of Port Phillip's plan reveals how local government fundamentally misunderstands what game developers actually need. While ambitiously aiming to make Victoria the "Games Capital," the plan focuses on ecosystem-level metrics like business numbers while completely ignoring individual financial survival. It acknowledges developers are stuck in "bootstrap and breadcrumbs funding cycles" but offers networking events and cultural programming as solutions. This disconnect between policy dreams and financial reality is exactly why I built the Brutal Budget Calculator.

## Connecting the Research

These three sources collectively explain the VPF's failure to create sustainable careers. The guidelines themselves create structural problems, the research shows success requires unfunded labor, and local policy acknowledges issues without offering real solutions. This is why practical tools like the Brutal Budget Calculator are essential - they help developers survive the gaps that institutional support systems leave unaddressed.
