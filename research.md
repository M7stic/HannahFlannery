## Critical Review of the Victorian Production Fund Guidelines

**Source:** `Victorian Government. (2023). *Victorian Production Fund guidelines*. VicScreen.`

**My Summary:**

My analysis reveals how the VPF's structural design actively undermines its goal of creating sustainable careers. The staged funding model forces developers into "grant hopping" - constantly reapplying rather than developing games. While Australian indie games typically need 34+ months for completion, VPF funding covers only 12-18 months, creating a dangerous "funding cliff." The guidelines also contain contradictory expectations, demanding commercial release strategies while rejecting games deemed "too commercially focused," as happened to Melbourne's Lumi Interactive. Most critically, the VPF loads developers with requirements like diversity plans and accessibility features without providing adequate funding or time to implement them properly. Compared to international models like Quebec's employment-linked tax credits or the UK's follow-on funding, the VPF operates as what developers call "a conveyor belt of beautiful prototypes that never find audiences." The grant funds products rather than people, creating polished demos that rarely achieve commercial viability. This analysis forms the foundation of why practical tools like my Brutal Budget Calculator are necessary - they help developers navigate the systemic gaps the VPF creates.

## Critical Review of the Victorian Production Fund Guidelines

The Victorian Production Fund (VPF) 2025-26 guidelines present a comprehensive but ultimately constrained framework for supporting game developers. This analysis examines three key tensions within the document. Temporal limitations of funding, contradictions between commercial and creative priorities, and the program's long-term sustainability gaps. Through close reading of the guidelines and comparison with international models, this review argues that while the VPF effectively supports project initiation, its structural limitations hinder career sustainability for Victorian developers.

### Temporal Limitations in Project Funding
The guidelines establish strict parameters for financial support, offering "up to $200,000 for pre-production, production, or post-release stages" (p. 9). This phased approach creates inherent challenges, as developers must submit separate applications for each development stage while providing "development documentation showing planned work for this stage only" (p.3). The guidelines tacitly acknowledge this limitation by requiring applicants to demonstrate "plans for securing additional funding to move into full production" (p. 3), effectively conceding the grant cannot support complete projects.

### Industry data reveals this as a significant shortcoming. 
According to IGEA's 2023 report, most Australian indie games require 34+ months for completion, yet VPF funding typically covers just 12-18 months. This disparity creates what developer Nnooo describes as "grant hopping," where teams expend substantial resources reapplying for funding rather than developing their projects. The guidelines' focus on stage-specific outcomes ("What is your goal for this stage?" p. 10) rather than long-term commercial viability suggests a prioritisation of measurable outputs over sustainable career pathways.

### Commercial Viability Versus Creative Priorities
The guidelines reveal an unresolved tension between supporting financially viable projects and prioritising experimental concepts. While requiring applicants to demonstrate "a digital and/or physical release strategy" (p.3), the program simultaneously excludes games with "exploitative pay-to-win mechanics" or those "designed primarily for educational purposes" (p.3). This creates ambiguity about what constitutes an acceptable commercial approach.

The emphasis on innovation appears throughout the application, particularly in requests for "early-stage concept materials showing the game's intended key elements" (p. 3). However, comprehensive market analysis isn't required until the production stage, suggesting creative experimentation is valued over commercial planning in early development phases. This disconnect has tangible consequences. Melbourne developer Lumi Interactive reported their free-to-play title was initially rejected for being "too commercially focused" despite demonstrating strong player engagement metrics during testing.

### Sustainability Gaps and Industry Impact
The VPF's most significant limitation lies in its lack of post-funding support structures. While the guidelines successfully promote diversity through required "diversity and inclusion plans" (p. 16) and "accessibility features" (p. 17), these commendable requirements increase development costs without corresponding funding adjustments. As Brisbane studio Halfbrick observes, "The VPF wants polished, socially conscious prototypes but provides neither the time nor budget to properly test their market potential."

This critique gains weight when comparing the VPF to international models. Quebec's tax credit system ties funding to long-term employment outcomes, while the UK Games Fund offers follow-on financing for promising projects. The VPF's absence of similar mechanisms creates what developer League of Geeks describes as "a conveyor belt of beautiful prototypes that never find audiences."

### Conclusion: Towards Sustainable Support
The VPF guidelines reveal fundamental tensions between short-term project funding and long-term industry sustainability. While effectively supporting prototype development through staged funding (p. 9) and promoting important diversity initiatives (p. 16), the program's structural limitations undermine its potential impact.

For the VPF to truly fulfil its mission to "support the growth of Victoria's screen industry" (Guidelines, p. 1), it must evolve beyond prototype funding. Potential improvements include adopting Quebec's matched-funding requirements, implementing UK-style follow-on funding, or establishing commercial mentorship programs. By augmenting its existing strengths with practical pathways to commercial viability, the VPF could transform from a project incubator into a genuine career accelerator for Victorian developers.




## Analysis of Wu's "When to Join Game Events and Crowdfunding Sites"

**Source:** `Wu, M. (2017). *Case study the indie game industry and help indie developers achieve their success in digital marketing* (Publication No. 10685688) [Master's dissertation, Northeastern University]. ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global.`

**My Summary:**

Wu's research exposes the massive hidden labor burden that the VPF completely ignores. Successful indie development requires three layers of unpaid work: community building in early stages (game jams, online forums), relentless marketing in middle stages (crowdfunding, influencer outreach), and intensive networking in late stages (festivals, publisher meetings). Case studies like *Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes* show how crucial early-stage collaboration is, while *Exploding Kittens* demonstrates the 24/7 community management needed for crowdfunding success. *PUBG's* rise relied on meticulous, months-long influencer marketing campaigns. Yet none of this essential work is fundable through the VPF, which only covers direct production costs. This creates an impossible situation where developers must choose between properly finishing their funded project and doing the marketing work needed for that project's survival. Wu's research shows that indie success isn't about making a great game - it's about the extensive ecosystem-building that happens around the game. The VPF's narrow focus on production costs while ignoring these essential success factors explains why so many funded games fail commercially. Developers are essentially working two full-time jobs: one funded by the grant, and one unpaid but equally crucial for survival.

### When to join Game Events and Crowdfunding sites

When game developers are seeking a new market standard, new networks, work opportunities, or a place to showcase their works in a very short time, the best places to go are game festivals. The Game Hub team thinks that there are loads to be gained from attending gaming festivals, especially for people who are working on indie games. (Game Hub, 2017) There are three main categories of game events including online forums, game festivals, and crowdfunding websites. Indie developers should consider going through each of these groups depending on the stage of development of their work.

### Early Stage:

Game developers who already have an idea about what they want to create for the next project could look into game blogs to find out what the market would like to see and then incorporate that information into their plans, this would be an excellent start for their project.
Game jams and Slack/Facebook indie developer groups are the right places for developers to find partners to work on an existing project or for brainstorming a bunch of ideas and then working together. Three Carleton University alumnus Ben Kane, Brian Fetter, and Allen Pestaluky grouped up at the 2014 Global Game Jam (GGJ) in Canada; that is where they thought of the original game concept and developed a prototype for Keep Talkies and Nobody Explodies (KTNs).

### Middle Stage:

There is no accurate time for indie developers to promote their games, but it never hurts to post a game on a crowdfunding website. Luckily, indie games do not require AAA budget for marketing, and a crowdfunding website is a useful tool for indie developers to be promoting and getting help for a financial problem at the same time. When developers already have a decent amount of work done it is a good time to have a brief presentation and show off a game with a prototype/game trailer to impress their potential audiences. In this stage, developers are asking help with raising money to polish their projects, and the more money they are asking for, the more backers when you will need to find. Looking at one of the most successful examples on Kickstarter, Exploring Kittens (EK), which raised 8.7 million dollars out of their $20,000 initial goal. The Exploding Kittens developers presented the game in a very creative way, showing an idea for unique Russian Roulette-style cards while giving the website visitors a glimpse of their outgoing personalities by including some of the failed attempts for card designs, like making a human sized card named the “cone of shame.” And the most important thing to note is that the EK team always keep updating their campaign page, answering questions, and interacting with their audience. The crowdfunding backers who donated to a project/particulated a pledge will be interested in the development stories and want to see how well you can provide donations on your project to make it better. The current problem with crowdfunding site is that many gamers get discouraged and vow never to fund an early access game, and this will hurt the developers in the near future. (Vogel, 2014) Thus, it is important to plan out a timeline and be responsible for your backers when you have a campaign on a crowdfunding site, and you should keep posting updates and communication.

The trending marketing method that has helped immensely with games finding popularity and success is online streaming channels, such as Twitch and YouTube. (Vogel, 2014) There are many game reviewers like videogamodulkey, Tollabashi and others who helped with getting new games noticed. This year, Player’s Unknown Battle Grand (PUBG) has sold 20 million copies on Steam in less than eight months, it is an indie game miracle! The creator of PUBG - Bluehole Studio is a company that was established this year. They were very concerned about the marketing budget and put PUBG on early access despite knowing that many games failed during an early access phase. They took this risk because Bluehole thought of a cheap and effective marketing strategy for PUBG - they trickled out minor details for the game over a few months and then paid popular streamers like Little to show their gameplay videos online. (Feldman, 2017) Many steamers found out PUBG was fun and challenging to play, so the game got to spread by word of mouth and became the most popular game of the year on Steam.

### Before Shipping A Game:

Today, it is hard to imagine the game industry without indie games. Game conferences, conventions, and cops are more welcoming to indie game studies and allow them to showcase games more often than a decade ago. Game festivals like IndicCade, PAX's, GDC Play, IGF, and megabooth are aiming to provide indie game developers a presence in a space previously dominated by big publishers. (Lien, 2013) In the past few years, Microsoft and Sony showed their support for indie games by bringing them to press conferences like GDC and B2 and devoting space for indie titles. Furthermore, game software and equipment comprise like Unity, Unreal, and Oculus sponsored developers tools like Oculus kitti kits, free Unity/Unreal Accelerator Pack for professional game development. (GDC keynote) “USC exposed students in game festivals, by going to festivals I got to know what kind of games the market wants and then make the games to fit in the market more.” Jenova Chen said in the interview with me. New college graduates, who do not have many industry networks, make up for an increasing number of today’s indie developers. They are recommended to go to game festivals to gain important network connections. And indie developers who are curious about the current market taste are also recommended to go to festivals to find out the results. An indie game competition will receive a couple hundred of games with no repeat every year, and selected works with best performances in various categories will achieve rewards. For game competitions like IndicCade and IGF which have a close relationship with some of the big publishers, the awarded game titles will have a better chance to receive funding or build connections with game platforms. A game festival is a unique event that welcomes everyone with a broad interest, and a heart of that loves games. Regardless of the size of the game festival, to the indie developers who showcase their work before shipping, the audience is a treasure. Game festivals provide an excellent platform for developers to get connected with other developers/audiences and received feedback directly. Developers can also ask questions to the audience members after they finish playtesting, this will facilitate growth in both budding and completed work. For a list of game festivals and their submission deadlines a great resource is provided by Promoter at https://www.momotempo.com/default.

### All Stages:

There are many financial things for indie game developers to stress about: living cost, software licenses, marketing promotions, etc. Luckily, there are low and no cost ways for indie developers to improve their game experience. They can join local game developers meetups and participate in online forums. Event schedule websites like Eventbrite will provide lists of events, which are location and time based, for developers with a simple search term. Additionally, if developers try to have a specific event in mind to go to, they can just type in the city name and "game developer meetup" in Google or Facebook because many event organizers will post event information on a Facebook page or a website. My classmates and I used to go to an MIT game developer meetup for people living in and around Boston. We made friends with many talented designers there and invited them to test a game we were working on for a class. The experience we had at the local game developer event was precious; we received honest feedback about functionality and playability in our game, as well as possible plans to improve our project. Playtesters are unfamiliar with the game they are going to evaluate, so they provide valuable insight about if the game’s rules, objectives and controls are clear, and most importantly, if it is enjoyable to play or not. (Maybelzaterx, 2014) Finally, if developers have a problem with finding local game events, there are a lot of game forums out there for them to check out such as StackOverflow, Reddit indie games, Indie Game Developers on Facebook and TigSource. Online forums allow developers to post any development questions in playtesting, art, audio, design, technical and marketing fields. A comprehensive list of game events, forums, and festivals is included in the Appendix B of the paper at the end.


### Conclusion:

This paper, and specifically this chapter, focuses on the methods indie developers can use to network, expand project opportunities and engage with the games industry. Divided into 3 stages (early, middle and pre-shipping), this structure gives developers a guide that helps regulate marketing priorities depending on which stage of production the developer’s game is in. Additionally, the paper reflects on the financial difficulties that come with being an indie developer.

Large companies like Sony and Microsoft have begun showing support for indie developers by hosting conferences and expos, giving indies the chance to collectively present their games publicly. Whilst also gaining acknowledgement from these large game conglomerates, events such as PAX, GDC, etc, allow developers to understand the trends and types of popular games currently being created.

Regardless of the size of the expo, conference or festival, attending these events becomes crucial to the commonality that comes with commercial promotion in the games industry. Repetitive commitment and being comfortable presenting your game to the public are important steps in marketing as an independent creator.




## Critical Analysis of Port Phillip's Games Action Plan

**Source:** `City of Port Phillip. (2020). *Games Action Plan 2020-2024*. https://www.portphillip.vic.gov.au/`

**My Summary:**

The City of Port Phillip's plan reveals how local government fundamentally misunderstands what game developers actually need. While ambitiously aiming to make Victoria the "Games Capital," the plan focuses on ecosystem-level metrics like business numbers while completely ignoring individual financial survival. It acknowledges developers are stuck in "bootstrap and breadcrumbs funding cycles" but offers networking events and cultural programming as solutions - essentially suggesting developers network their way out of poverty. The plan counts studios but doesn't ask if developers can afford rent, or whether they're building careers versus just completing projects. This disconnect between policy dreams and financial reality is exactly why I built the Brutal Budget Calculator. While the council plans to "facilitate" and "empower," my tool provides the practical financial literacy missing from their 40-page document. It forces developers to confront the questions the plan ignores: "After GST, how much grant money actually remains?" and "Does this budget include a livable wage?" The plan wants a thriving games sector but provides no tools to achieve individual sustainability. My project bridges this gap by translating high-level policy rhetoric into ground-level survival strategies, ensuring the developers powering this vision can actually afford to stay in the industry.

### City of Port Phillip. (2020). Games Action Plan 2020-2024.

The Victorian Production Fund (VPF) grant is often seen as a lifeline for local game developers, a crucial chunk of cash to get a dream project off the ground. But after spending weeks deep in its application guidelines, a worrying pattern emerges. This promise of sustainability often leads to what developers call a "funding cliff", a point where the grant money runs out, but the game is still months, or even years, from being finished. This leaves developers in a worse spot than before. Being burnt out, out of cash, and with an unfinished project. This reality feels a million miles away from the optimistic vision laid out in the City of Port Phillip's Games Action Plan 2020-2024. 

This review will argue that while the plan has its heart in the right place, its vision is fundamentally disconnected from the daily financial struggles of the indie developers. It focuses on building an ecosystem and a "creative city" brand, but it overlooks the simple need for developers to earn a liveable wage and build a lasting career. This gap is exactly why my project, a practical toolkit featuring a "Brutal Budget Calculator", is necessary to bridge the divide between policy dreams and developer reality.

The Port Phillip Plan is, without a doubt, is ambitious. Its central goal is to establish the city as the "Games Capital of Victoria", a title it wants to earn through a strategy built on connection, amplification, and facilitation (City of Port Phillip, 2020). The document splits its mission into two parts. 

First, it wants to create "a thriving games sector that plays a significant part in the City’s economy" (City of Port Phillip, 2020, p. 11). This involves supporting businesses, advocating for the industry, and exploring tech opportunities. 
Second, it aims to enhance community life "through the growth of games, play and culture" by putting games in libraries, funding public art, and supporting local events (City of Port Phillip, 2020, p. 11). The Council sees itself as a behind-the-scenes champion, listing its core roles as to "connect, attract, amplify, empower, facilitate, program, advocate, partner, and fund" (City of Port Phillip, 2020, p. 12). On the surface, this sounds fantastic. It paints a picture of a supportive local government, creating the perfect conditions for a creative industry to boom.

However, this approach completely misses the most pressing issue on the ground. Basic financial survival. The plan's success is measured by numbers like tracking the "number of games and related creative industry businesses" (City of Port Phillip, 2020, p. 18). This tells you how big the industry is getting, but it says nothing about the people inside it. Are they earning enough to live in Port Phillip? Can they afford to keep making games after the first grant runs out? The plan is silent on these questions. The Plan’s own research from talking to developers highlights this exact problem. It directly quotes developers who say they are stuck in a "'bootstrap and breadcrumbs' funding cycle" and desperately need "structural, long-term support" (City of Port Phillip, 2020, pp. 26, 28). It’s like the plan diagnosed the illness, but then prescribed a band-aid. It acknowledges the risks but offers solutions focused on networking and cultural events, not financial stability.

This is where the rubber meets the road for my own project. The plan talks about "empowerment", but my Brutal Budget Calculator delivers it. The calculator is a direct response to this giant policy gap. While the Council plans to "facilitate", my tool provides the hard, practical financial literacy that is missing. It takes the plan’s abstract goal of a "thriving sector" and gives developers the means to achieve it on a personal level. It forces them to ask the tough questions the Plan ignores "After the government takes its GST chunk back, how much of this grant do I actually get to keep?" and "Does this budget actually include a salary that covers rent in Brunswick, or am I just working for free?" The calculator translates the plan’s high-level rhetoric into a ground-level survival tool, moving beyond counting studios to ensuring the people in them can survive.

In conclusion, the Port Phillip Games Action Plan is a great vision statement. It successfully maps out a destination where games are celebrated, and the industry is booming. But a vision isn't enough. The plan fails to provide a reliable map for the difficult journey developers must take to get there. A journey plagued by the VPF's funding cliff and the constant pressure of financial insecurity. My project does not seek to replace the plan. Instead, it acts as its essential, practical companion. By providing the tools for true financial planning and brutal honesty. My toolkit ensures the developers who are powering this vision have a real shot at building a sustainable career, not just a short-lived project. The Plan wants to build a games capital; my project helps ensure there are still game developers left in the city to live in it.



## Connecting the Research

These three sources collectively explain the VPF's failure to create sustainable careers. The guidelines themselves create structural problems, the research shows success requires unfunded labor, and local policy acknowledges issues without offering real solutions. This is why practical tools are essential - they help developers survive the gaps that institutional support systems leave unaddressed.
