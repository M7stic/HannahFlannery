### When to join Game Events and Crowdfunding sites

When game developers are seeking a new market standard, new networks, work opportunities, or a place to showcase their works in a very short time, the best places to go are game festivals. The Game Hub team thinks that there are loads to be gained from attending gaming festivals, especially for people who are working on indie games. (Game Hub, 2017) There are three main categories of game events including online forums, game festivals, and crowdfunding websites. Indie developers should consider going through each of these groups depending on the stage of development of their work.

### Early Stage:

Game developers who already have an idea about what they want to create for the next project could look into game blogs to find out what the market would like to see and then incorporate that information into their plans, this would be an excellent start for their project.
Game jams and Slack/Facebook indie developer groups are the right places for developers to find partners to work on an existing project or for brainstorming a bunch of ideas and then working together. Three Carleton University alumnus Ben Kane, Brian Fetter, and Allen Pestaluky grouped up at the 2014 Global Game Jam (GGJ) in Canada; that is where they thought of the original game concept and developed a prototype for Keep Talkies and Nobody Explodies (KTNs).

### Middle Stage:

There is no accurate time for indie developers to promote their games, but it never hurts to post a game on a crowdfunding website. Luckily, indie games do not require AAA budget for marketing, and a crowdfunding website is a useful tool for indie developers to be promoting and getting help for a financial problem at the same time. When developers already have a decent amount of work done it is a good time to have a brief presentation and show off a game with a prototype/game trailer to impress their potential audiences. 

In this stage, developers are asking help with raising money to polish their projects, and the more money they are asking for, the more backers when you will need to find. Looking at one of the most successful examples on Kickstarter, Exploring Kittens (EK), which raised 8.7 million dollars out of their $20,000 initial goal. The Exploding Kittens developers presented the game in a very creative way, showing an idea for unique Russian Roulette-style cards while giving the website visitors a glimpse of their outgoing personalities by including some of the failed attempts for card designs, like making a human sized card named the “cone of shame.” And the most important thing to note is that the EK team always keep updating their campaign page, answering questions, and interacting with their audience. 

The crowdfunding backers who donated to a project/particulated a pledge will be interested in the development stories and want to see how well you can provide donations on your project to make it better. The current problem with crowdfunding site is that many gamers get discouraged and vow never to fund an early access game, and this will hurt the developers in the near future. (Vogel, 2014) Thus, it is important to plan out a timeline and be responsible for your backers when you have a campaign on a crowdfunding site, and you should keep posting updates and communication.

The trending marketing method that has helped immensely with games finding popularity and success is online streaming channels, such as Twitch and YouTube. (Vogel, 2014) There are many game reviewers like videogamodulkey, Tollabashi and others who helped with getting new games noticed. This year, Player’s Unknown Battle Grand (PUBG) has sold 20 million copies on Steam in less than eight months, it is an indie game miracle! 

The creator of PUBG - Bluehole Studio is a company that was established this year. They were very concerned about the marketing budget and put PUBG on early access despite knowing that many games failed during an early access phase. They took this risk because Bluehole thought of a cheap and effective marketing strategy for PUBG - they trickled out minor details for the game over a few months and then paid popular streamers like Little to show their gameplay videos online. (Feldman, 2017) Many steamers found out PUBG was fun and challenging to play, so the game got to spread by word of mouth and became the most popular game of the year on Steam.

### Before Shipping A Game:

Today, it is hard to imagine the game industry without indie games. Game conferences, conventions, and cops are more welcoming to indie game studies and allow them to showcase games more often than a decade ago. Game festivals like IndicCade, PAX's, GDC Play, IGF, and megabooth are aiming to provide indie game developers a presence in a space previously dominated by big publishers. (Lien, 2013) In the past few years, Microsoft and Sony showed their support for indie games by bringing them to press conferences like GDC and B2 and devoting space for indie titles. 

Furthermore, game software and equipment comprise like Unity, Unreal, and Oculus sponsored developers tools like Oculus kitti kits, free Unity/Unreal Accelerator Pack for professional game development. (GDC keynote) “USC exposed students in game festivals, by going to festivals I got to know what kind of games the market wants and then make the games to fit in the market more.” Jenova Chen said in the interview with me. New college graduates, who do not have many industry networks, make up for an increasing number of today’s indie developers. 

They are recommended to go to game festivals to gain important network connections. And indie developers who are curious about the current market taste are also recommended to go to festivals to find out the results. An indie game competition will receive a couple hundred of games with no repeat every year, and selected works with best performances in various categories will achieve rewards. 

For game competitions like IndicCade and IGF which have a close relationship with some of the big publishers, the awarded game titles will have a better chance to receive funding or build connections with game platforms. A game festival is a unique event that welcomes everyone with a broad interest, and a heart of that loves games. Regardless of the size of the game festival, to the indie developers who showcase their work before shipping, the audience is a treasure. Game festivals provide an excellent platform for developers to get connected with other developers/audiences and received feedback directly. Developers can also ask questions to the audience members after they finish playtesting, this will facilitate growth in both budding and completed work.

### All Stages:

There are many financial things for indie game developers to stress about: living cost, software licenses, marketing promotions, etc. Luckily, there are low and no cost ways for indie developers to improve their game experience. They can join local game developers meetups and participate in online forums. Event schedule websites like Eventbrite will provide lists of events, which are location and time based, for developers with a simple search term. 

Additionally, if developers try to have a specific event in mind to go to, they can just type in the city name and "game developer meetup" in Google or Facebook because many event organizers will post event information on a Facebook page or a website. 

My classmates and I used to go to an MIT game developer meetup for people living in and around Boston. We made friends with many talented designers there and invited them to test a game we were working on for a class. The experience we had at the local game developer event was precious; we received honest feedback about functionality and playability in our game, as well as possible plans to improve our project. 

Playtesters are unfamiliar with the game they are going to evaluate, so they provide valuable insight about if the game’s rules, objectives and controls are clear, and most importantly, if it is enjoyable to play or not. (Maybelzaterx, 2014) Finally, if developers have a problem with finding local game events, there are a lot of game forums out there for them to check out such as StackOverflow, Reddit indie games, Indie Game Developers on Facebook and TigSource. Online forums allow developers to post any development questions in playtesting, art, audio, design, technical and marketing fields. A comprehensive list of game events, forums, and festivals is included in the Appendix B of the paper at the end.


### Conclusion:

This paper, and specifically this chapter, focuses on the methods indie developers can use to network, expand project opportunities and engage with the games industry. Divided into 3 stages (early, middle and pre-shipping), this structure gives developers a guide that helps regulate marketing priorities depending on which stage of production the developer’s game is in. Additionally, the paper reflects on the financial difficulties that come with being an indie developer.

Large companies like Sony and Microsoft have begun showing support for indie developers by hosting conferences and expos, giving indies the chance to collectively present their games publicly. Whilst also gaining acknowledgement from these large game conglomerates, events such as PAX, GDC, etc, allow developers to understand the trends and types of popular games currently being created.

Regardless of the size of the expo, conference or festival, attending these events becomes crucial to the commonality that comes with commercial promotion in the games industry. Repetitive commitment and being comfortable presenting your game to the public are important steps in marketing as an independent creator.
