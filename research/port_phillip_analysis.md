### City of Port Phillip. (2020). Games Action Plan 2020-2024.

The Victorian Production Fund (VPF) grant is often seen as a lifeline for local game developers, a crucial chunk of cash to get a dream project off the ground. But after spending weeks deep in its application guidelines, a worrying pattern emerges. This promise of sustainability often leads to what developers call a "funding cliff", a point where the grant money runs out, but the game is still months, or even years, from being finished. This leaves developers in a worse spot than before. Being burnt out, out of cash, and with an unfinished project. This reality feels a million miles away from the optimistic vision laid out in the City of Port Phillip's Games Action Plan 2020-2024. 

This review will argue that while the plan has its heart in the right place, its vision is fundamentally disconnected from the daily financial struggles of the indie developers. It focuses on building an ecosystem and a "creative city" brand, but it overlooks the simple need for developers to earn a liveable wage and build a lasting career. This gap is exactly why my project, a practical toolkit featuring a "Brutal Budget Calculator", is necessary to bridge the divide between policy dreams and developer reality.

The Port Phillip Plan is, without a doubt, is ambitious. Its central goal is to establish the city as the "Games Capital of Victoria", a title it wants to earn through a strategy built on connection, amplification, and facilitation (City of Port Phillip, 2020). The document splits its mission into two parts. 

First, it wants to create "a thriving games sector that plays a significant part in the City’s economy" (City of Port Phillip, 2020, p. 11). This involves supporting businesses, advocating for the industry, and exploring tech opportunities. 
Second, it aims to enhance community life "through the growth of games, play and culture" by putting games in libraries, funding public art, and supporting local events (City of Port Phillip, 2020, p. 11). The Council sees itself as a behind-the-scenes champion, listing its core roles as to "connect, attract, amplify, empower, facilitate, program, advocate, partner, and fund" (City of Port Phillip, 2020, p. 12). On the surface, this sounds fantastic. It paints a picture of a supportive local government, creating the perfect conditions for a creative industry to boom.

However, this approach completely misses the most pressing issue on the ground. Basic financial survival. The plan's success is measured by numbers like tracking the "number of games and related creative industry businesses" (City of Port Phillip, 2020, p. 18). This tells you how big the industry is getting, but it says nothing about the people inside it. Are they earning enough to live in Port Phillip? Can they afford to keep making games after the first grant runs out? The plan is silent on these questions. The Plan’s own research from talking to developers highlights this exact problem. It directly quotes developers who say they are stuck in a "'bootstrap and breadcrumbs' funding cycle" and desperately need "structural, long-term support" (City of Port Phillip, 2020, pp. 26, 28). It’s like the plan diagnosed the illness, but then prescribed a band-aid. It acknowledges the risks but offers solutions focused on networking and cultural events, not financial stability.

This is where the rubber meets the road for my own project. The plan talks about "empowerment", but my Brutal Budget Calculator delivers it. The calculator is a direct response to this giant policy gap. While the Council plans to "facilitate", my tool provides the hard, practical financial literacy that is missing. It takes the plan’s abstract goal of a "thriving sector" and gives developers the means to achieve it on a personal level. It forces them to ask the tough questions the Plan ignores "After the government takes its GST chunk back, how much of this grant do I actually get to keep?" and "Does this budget actually include a salary that covers rent in Brunswick, or am I just working for free?" The calculator translates the plan’s high-level rhetoric into a ground-level survival tool, moving beyond counting studios to ensuring the people in them can survive.

In conclusion, the Port Phillip Games Action Plan is a great vision statement. It successfully maps out a destination where games are celebrated, and the industry is booming. But a vision isn't enough. The plan fails to provide a reliable map for the difficult journey developers must take to get there. A journey plagued by the VPF's funding cliff and the constant pressure of financial insecurity. My project does not seek to replace the plan. Instead, it acts as its essential, practical companion. By providing the tools for true financial planning and brutal honesty. My toolkit ensures the developers who are powering this vision have a real shot at building a sustainable career, not just a short-lived project. The Plan wants to build a games capital; my project helps ensure there are still game developers left in the city to live in it.
