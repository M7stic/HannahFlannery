# The VPF Application Guide: What They Don't Tell You

## So... What Even Is This?

Okay, so for the past eight weeks I've been basically living and breathing the VPF grant. I've read the guidelines until my eyes hurt, talked to developers who've been through the absolute rollercoaster of this process, and built this whole toolkit because honestly? The application process feels like they're speaking a different language sometimes.

When I started this project, I thought I was just going to make a simple guide. But then I kept hearing the same thing from developers: "I got the grant, but now I'm more stressed than before." That's when I realised there was something bigger going on here.

The big question I've been trying to answer is: **does this grant actually help developers build proper careers, or does it just give you temporary relief before you hit what everyone calls the "funding cliff"?**

## My Research Journey - From Confused to (Slightly Less) Confused

I started by just reading the VPF guidelines. And then reading them again. And then making about a million notes in the margins. The official documents are... well, they're very official. They use words like "leverage" and "synergy" a lot, but they don't really tell you what it's actually like to live on this money.

So I did what any good researcher would do - I went and talked to people. I surveyed Victorian developers, from solo creators to small studios. Their stories were all different, but they kept hitting the same walls:

- The money runs out way before the game is finished
- The reporting requirements take up so much time they can't actually develop
- Nobody tells you about the GST thing (seriously, why does nobody mention the GST thing?!)
- You end up spending more time writing grant applications than making games

Then I hit the academic stuff, and honestly? It was kind of reassuring to find out that these problems aren't just happening here. There's this whole field of study about "precarious work" in creative industries, and reading it felt like someone had been spying on our local game dev scene.

## Breaking Down the Application (Without the Corporate Jargon)

### The DEI Section - It's Not Just About Hiring

**What VicScreen Says:** "Describe your project and team's current state in terms of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion"

**What They Actually Mean:** They want to know if you've actually integrated these ideas into your creative process or if you're just copying buzzwords from a corporate website.

People write things like "We support diversity" or "We will hire diversely." Like, cool, but what does that actually mean for YOUR game? What does it mean for the stories you're telling?

Here's the thing I learned from reading Banks and Hesmondhalgh's research: when diversity becomes just another box to tick, it doesn't actually make anything better. It just becomes paperwork. But when you actually think about how different perspectives can make your work more interesting? That's when it gets powerful.

**Bad Example I Keep Seeing:**
"We believe in diversity and will ensure our hiring practices are inclusive." (So vague they probably see this exact sentence ten times a day)

**Actually Good Example:**
"Our game explores what it means to grow up between cultures because our writer actually lived that experience. We've budgeted to bring in sensitivity readers from specific communities to make sure we're telling these stories properly, not just using them as set dressing."

The difference is that one shows you've actually thought about it, and the other shows you've thought about what they want to hear.

### The Accessibility Stuff - You Gotta Do This For Real

**What VicScreen Says:** "Consult the Game Accessibility Guidelines"

**Translation:** This isn't optional, and they will absolutely check if you've actually looked at them.

I get why people treat this as an afterthought. When you're trying to just get your game made, accessibility can feel like extra homework. But here's what changed my perspective: when I actually played some games with proper accessibility features, I realised they're just... better games. Like, even if you don't "need" the high contrast mode, it's nice to have when you're playing in a sunny room.

**What I See People Do:**
"We'll add colourblind mode and maybe some subtitle options." (This is the equivalent of saying "I'll clean my room" by shoving everything under the bed)

**What Actually Impresses Them:**
"We're implementing specific Game Accessibility Guidelines including Motor 1.1 for fully remappable controls, Vision 2.1.1 for high contrast UI, and Cognitive 4.1.1 for clear language throughout. We've budgeted 25 hours specifically for accessibility testing with actual disabled gamers because we know we'll miss things if we just guess."

See the difference? One says "we'll do the bare minimum," the other says "we understand this is part of making a quality product."

### The Budget - Where Dreams Meet Reality

Okay, this is the part where everyone messes up, including me when I first started looking at this. That $150,000 grant everyone talks about? After GST it's actually $136,363. I built my budget calculator specifically because I kept hearing stories of developers who got the grant and then had that "oh crap" moment when they realised the numbers didn't add up.

Here's what most people don't account for:

**The GST Trap:** You get the grant money including GST, but then you have to pay that GST back to the government. So right off the bat, you're down 10%. Why does nobody mention this in the cheerful "you got the grant!" announcements?

**The "Can I Actually Live On This?" Question:** I've seen budgets where developers are paying themselves like $30,000 for a year's work. In Melbourne. Where the average rent is like $25,000 a year. It's mathematical insanity.

**The Hidden Time Costs:** The reporting requirements, the meetings, the paperwork - none of that is in the "making the game" part of your budget, but it takes up so much time.

When I ran the numbers through my calculator for a typical indie project, most VPF grants only cover 6-9 months of actual development work if you're paying people properly.

## The Whole "Funding Cliff" Thing - It's Real

So there's this concept in creative industries called "precarious work" that I found in the academic literature. Basically, it means you're always one project away from being broke, no matter how successful you look from the outside. The VPF kind of makes this worse because of how the funding is structured.

My survey data shows this pretty clearly - 50% of developers said their single biggest financial challenge is "funding development long enough to finish the game." Only 12.5% said they had no financial problems because their project was fully funded.

Think about it: you spend months on the application (one developer told me they found it "very competitive, a lot of time and work must be spent on application materials to stand a chance"), you get the grant, you work like crazy for 12-18 months, and then... the money runs out. But your game isn't finished. So now you're in this horrible position where you have this partially completed project.

The time commitment is massive too. One developer straight up said it was "time consuming, difficult filling out all the documents." Another mentioned it's "very time consuming to make sure all of the material speaks to each other." This is time they're not spending actually making games.

## Making This Actually Sustainable (Because Apparently That's Not the Default)

I found this dissertation by Wu that looked at how indie games actually succeed in the real world, and it was kind of eye-opening. Success isn't just about making a good game - it's about all this other work that happens around the game:

**Community Building:** You need people who care about your game before it even comes out.

**Marketing:** You can't just release a game and hope people find it.

**Networking:** Going to events, meeting other developers, building relationships.

Here's the kicker: the VPF doesn't pay for any of that. So you're basically working multiple jobs: one that's funded (making the game) and one that's not (everything else that makes the game successful).

## What Developers Actually Want From Resources Like This

My survey asked what one thing would help most with funding applications, and the answers were super practical:

- "Realistic budget examples & resources (most creatives have no experience on budgets)"
- "A template and example"
- "Automatic budgets for team size and amount"
- "Feedback - getting someone to look over it before submission"

This is exactly why I built the Brutal Budget Calculator and why this guide includes actual examples instead of just theory. Developers don't need more vague advice - they need concrete tools.

The budget confidence question was really telling too - answers were all over the place from 2 to 10 out of 10, with most people clustering around 6-8. That means even experienced developers aren't totally sure they're getting the budgeting right.

## The Local Context - We're Trying to Be the "Games Capital" But...

The City of Port Phillip has this whole Games Action Plan about making Victoria the "Games Capital." It sounds great on paper - who doesn't want to be the capital of something cool? But when you actually read the plan, it's all about counting how many studios we have and how many jobs we're creating.

What it doesn't talk about is whether the people in those jobs can actually afford to live here. Or whether they're building careers or just jumping from one temporary project to the next.

The plan actually admits that developers are stuck in what they call "bootstrap and breadcrumbs" funding cycles (their words, not mine!). But then their solution is... more networking events? More meetups? Don't get me wrong, community is important, but you can't pay your rent with community.

This gap between the big vision and the daily reality is exactly why I built the Brutal Budget Calculator. While the council is talking about "facilitation" and "ecosystem building," my calculator asks the questions that actually matter: "After GST, how much money do you actually have?" and "Can you afford to eat while you make this game?"

## So Here's What Actually Works (Based on All the Stuff I've Learned)

After all this research - the academic reading, the developer interviews, the policy analysis - here's what I've figured out about making the VPF work for you instead of just working you:

### 1. Treat DEI and Accessibility Like They're Creative Opportunities
Stop thinking of these as boxes to tick. Better diversity makes better stories. Better accessibility makes better games. Frame them as ways to make your work more interesting, not as burdens.

### 2. Be Brutally Honest About the Money
Use my calculator. Actually pay yourself a wage you can live on. Account for the GST. Plan for the fact that things always take longer and cost more than you think. If the numbers don't work with sustainable wages, maybe this isn't the right funding for your project right now.

### 3. Plan for the Day After the Grant Ends
What's your plan for when the money runs out? Do you have another funding source lined up? Are you going to Early Access? Do you have savings? Nobody wants to think about this when they're applying, but you have to.

### 4. Show Them You Understand the Bigger Picture
Talk about what comes after the VPF. Show them you've thought about how this project fits into your long-term career, not just this one game.

### 5. Build Your Support Systems Now
The developers who survive the VPF process are the ones who have communities, networks, and support systems. Start building those now, not when you're in crisis mode.

## The Big Takeaway

The VPF can be a stepping stone instead of a dead end, but you have to be smarter about it than the application process makes you be. You have to see past the official language and understand what you're actually signing up for.

This grant won't magically solve all your problems, but if you go in with your eyes open and a solid plan for what happens when the money runs out, it can be the boost that helps you build something sustainable.

Or as one developer told me: "The VPF gives you enough rope to either build a bridge or hang yourself. Make sure you know how to build bridges."
